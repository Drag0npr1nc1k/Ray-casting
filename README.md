To run the engine you will need the numpy and pygame libraries
```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```
After that you can make engine settings. In the `settings.py` file you can find the engine settings, in the future I want to make it possible to customize every little thing

To start the engine you need to run the `run.py` file

If you want to experiment, you can create your own map by opening the `map.py` file and changing the worldMap array 1 is the wall, and 0 is the empty space that the player can walk on.
